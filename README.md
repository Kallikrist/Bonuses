## How It Works

1. **🏢 Company Setup**: Create companies and workplaces with unique identifiers
2. **🎯 Target Assignment**: Admins set daily sales targets for specific workplaces and employees
3. **👥 Team Collaboration**: Employees can join targets as team members (with admin approval for submitted targets)
4. **📝 Sales Submission**: Employees submit their actual sales amounts for approval
5. **✅ Approval Workflow**: Admins review and approve submissions or team change requests
6. **💰 Points Calculation**: Points are automatically awarded when sales exceed targets (10%+ threshold)
7. **🔄 Automatic Adjustments**: Points are recalculated if targets are modified or team members are added/removed
8. **🎁 Bonus Redemption**: Employees redeem earned points for bonuses from the catalog
9. **📊 Analytics**: Track performance with charts, trends, and detailed transaction history
10. **💾 Data Persistence**: All data is stored locally with automatic migrations and integrity checks

## Demo Accounts

The app comes with pre-configured demo accounts:

### Admin Account:
- **Email**: admin@store.com
- **Password**: password123
- **Role**: Store Manager (Admin)

### Employee Accounts:
- **Email**: john@store.com
- **Password**: password123
- **Role**: Employee

- **Email**: jane@store.com
- **Password**: password123
- **Role**: Employee

## Points Calculation

### Earning Points
- Points are awarded when daily sales targets are exceeded by **10% or more**
- Formula: `(percentage_above_target / 10) * 10`
- Examples:
  - 20% above target → 20 points
  - 30% above target → 30 points
  - 50% above target → 50 points

### Team Points Distribution
- For collaborative targets, all team members receive equal points
- Points are calculated based on the total team sales vs. target
- Admin team participation points: 5 points per target joined

### Points Adjustments
- **Automatic Recalculation**: When admin modifies target amount, all member points are recalculated
- **Member Removal**: Points are automatically withdrawn if member is removed from approved target
- **Member Addition**: Points are awarded when member is added to approved target
- **Audit Trail**: All adjustments are logged in transaction history with detailed descriptions
