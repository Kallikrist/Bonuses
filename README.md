# Bonuses App

A comprehensive Flutter application for managing employee bonuses and rewards based on sales targets. This app enables multi-company management with role-based access, allowing store managers (admins) to set daily sales targets, track performance, and reward employees who exceed their goals.

## Features

- 🎯 **Team Collaboration**: Join targets as team member or request team changes
- 💰 **Points System**: Earn points automatically when exceeding sales targets
- 🎁 **Bonus Redemption**: Browse and redeem available bonuses from catalog
- 📈 **Performance Analytics**: View weekly performance charts and trends
- 💬 **Messaging**: Send and receive messages with admins and team members
- 📅 **Calendar Integration**: View target history and select specific dates
- 🔔 **Real-time Updates**: Get instant notifications for target assignments and approvals
- 🎨 **Customizable UI**: Personalize header shortcuts and bottom navigation

### For Admins (Store Managers):
- 🎯 **Target Management**: Create daily sales targets with workplace and employee assignments
- 👥 **Team Coordination**: Manage collaborative targets with multiple team members
- ✅ **Approval System**: Review and approve employee sales submissions and team requests
- 📊 **Performance Dashboard**: Track sales performance with interactive charts and statistics
- 🏢 **Multi-Company Support**: Manage multiple companies and workplaces from one account
- 🎁 **Bonus Catalog**: Import and manage bonus offerings for employees

- 📈 **Advanced Analytics**: View top performers, weekly trends, and detailed reports
- ⚙️ **Customization**: Configure dashboard layout, navigation, and header shortcuts

## How It Works

1. **🏢 Company Setup**: Create companies and workplaces with unique identifiers
2. **🎯 Target Assignment**: Admins set daily sales targets for specific workplaces and employees
3. **👥 Team Collaboration**: Employees can join targets as team members (with admin approval for submitted targets)
4. **📝 Sales Submission**: Employees submit their actual sales amounts for approval
5. **✅ Approval Workflow**: Admins review and approve submissions or team change requests
6. **💰 Points Calculation**: Points are automatically awarded when sales exceed targets (10%+ threshold)
7. **🔄 Automatic Adjustments**: Points are recalculated if targets are modified or team members are added/removed
8. **🎁 Bonus Redemption**: Employees redeem earned points for bonuses from the catalog
9. **📊 Analytics**: Track performance with charts, trends, and detailed transaction history
10. **💾 Data Persistence**: All data is stored locally with automatic migrations and integrity checks

## Demo Accounts

The app comes with pre-configured demo accounts:

### Admin Account:
- **Email**: admin@store.com
- **Password**: password123
- **Role**: Store Manager (Admin)

### Employee Accounts:
- **Email**: john@store.com
- **Password**: password123
- **Role**: Employee

- **Email**: jane@store.com
- **Password**: password123
- **Role**: Employee

## Points Calculation

### Earning Points
- Points are awarded when daily sales targets are exceeded by **10% or more**
- Formula: `(percentage_above_target / 10) * 10`
- Examples:
  - 20% above target → 20 points
  - 30% above target → 30 points
  - 50% above target → 50 points

### Team Points Distribution
- For collaborative targets, all team members receive equal points
- Points are calculated based on the total team sales vs. target
- Admin team participation points: 5 points per target joined

### Points Adjustments
- **Automatic Recalculation**: When admin modifies target amount, all member points are recalculated
- **Member Removal**: Points are automatically withdrawn if member is removed from approved target
- **Member Addition**: Points are awarded when member is added to approved target
- **Audit Trail**: All adjustments are logged in transaction history with detailed descriptions

## Sample Bonuses

The app includes pre-configured bonuses:
- **Free Coffee** - 50 points
- **Extra Break** - 100 points
- **Gift Card** - 200 points
- **Day Off** - 500 points
